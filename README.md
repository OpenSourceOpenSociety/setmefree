*Problem*
- increasingly we're starting to realise how toxic it is to let companies use our online presence for their profit. It used to feel harmless. Billion dollar companies provided these great services that made life online really easy,fun,interesting. We didn't really care about them getting access to our private lives, because they couldn't possibly know anything about us. We told ourselves we'll just use this for a while and then get off when a paid equivalent comes along.

But it has been a few years now, and Google is the defacto search tool. They know every single thing you've wondered about over the entirety of your relationship with them. Every doubt, curiosity, interest, kink exploration.

Google is but one example, Facebook know you inside out too, and only recently has it come to light just how pervaisive their knowledge is <Insert Brexit & trump data articles - cambridge company.>

## Getting off social
* Check the locks
  * Checking the perimeter (What do they know?)
  * Closing the gate (Who can see what?)
  * Regaining some privacy
  * Silence the motorway (tools to tame your feeds)
* Breaking free
    * Baby steps
    * Get out of my pocket
* Leaving a note

  Given the how widespread social media is now an absence of social media presence can often "ring alarm bells" for those looking to get to know you (whether it's a personal or professional scenario). It's getting to the stage where you are abnormal if you don't use social media. <What about anti-social media?>

   Leaving a parting note on each of the networks you've abandoned gives you a chance to explain your absence.
